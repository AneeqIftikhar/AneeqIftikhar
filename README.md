# Hi Welcome to My Github! ðŸ‘‹

I am a dynamic and passionate individual who has the perfect combination of tech and stakeholder management skills. I have excellent communication skills and my years of experience in software industry allows me to work with minimum supervision with giving clear updates and coms within the team and other stakeholders. I have worked with both tech and non-tech founders, which has enabled me to deliver with more clarity. 

I have worked with large and small dev teams as senior backend engineer on multiple tech stacks, I started my journey as backend engineer focusing on PHP (Laravel, CodeIgniter), I changed tech to Javascript (NodeJS) and sticking to it now. I have explored and implemented advanced concepts and topics in NodeJS, bringing multiple apps to production.
